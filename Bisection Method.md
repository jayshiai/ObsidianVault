Based on the repeated application of intermediate value property.

Let $f(x)$ be continuous between `a` and `b` 

& let $f(a)$ be `-ve`
& let $f(b)$ be `+ve`

Then first approximation of root is 

$$ x = \dfrac{a+b}{2}$$
if $f(x)$ is `-ve` , then replace `a` with `x` and repeat above process.
if $f(x)$ is `+ve` , then replace `b` with `x` and repeat above process.

Repeat until we reach the root!
