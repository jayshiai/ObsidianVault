# Architecture

- Architecture is attributes that are visible to the programmer.
	- Instruction Set
	- Number of bits used for data representation
	- I/O mechanisms
	- Memory addressing techniques

# Organization

- Organization is how different architectural feature are implemented.
	- Control Signals
	- Interfaces between computer and peripherals
	- Memory technology used

# Program Concept

- Hardwired systems are inflexible
- General purpose hardware can do different tasks, given correct control signals

## What is program?
1. Sequence of steps
2. Each step, an arithmetic or logical operation is done.
3. For each operation, a different set of control signals are needed.

## Function of Control Unit 
- Provides unique code for each operation eg. ADD, MOVE
- A hardware segment accepts the code and issues the control signals
