- Mechanism by which other modules like I/O may interrupt normal sequence of processing. Some **classes** of interrupts are :-
	- **Program** - Generated by some condition that occurs as  
		- overflow
		- division by zero
		- attempt to execute illegal machine instruction
		- reference outside a user's allowed memory space
	- **Timer** - Generated by internal clock. Used in pre-emptive multitasking
	- **I/O **- From I/O controller
	- **Hardware failure** - memory parity error

## Interrupt Cycle

- Processor checks for interrupt.
	- Indicated by an interrupt signal.
- If no interrupt, fetch next instruction
- If interrupt pending:
	- Suspend execution of current program.
	- Save context:: saving the address of next instruction to be executed after resume and other relevant data.
	- Set PC to the starting address of interrupt handler routine
	- Process interrupt
	- Restore context and continue interrupted program.
