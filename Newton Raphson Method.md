Eqn of Tangent :
$$
 y - f(x_0) = f'(x_0)(x_1-x_0)
$$

For $(x,y) = (x_0,0)$ 
`Note : Take `$x_0$` so that `$f(x_0)$ ` is closer to 0`
we get 
$$
x_1 = x_0  - \dfrac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}
$$ then we put $(x,y) = (x_1,0)$ in above equation to get $x_2$ and so on until root converges. i.e. $f(x_n) = 0$ then $x_n$ is the root.
